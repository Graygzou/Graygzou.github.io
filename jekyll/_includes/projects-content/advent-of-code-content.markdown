I started out this section without completing the 2018 edition because I wanted to practice my C++.
But I move on to something else since then.

To be continued.

### Blog post
I wrote a small article about my experience. You can find it here: [blog article]({% post_url /blog/2019-10-09-advent-of-code-2018 %})

### Personal progression
Since it was my first year doing this challenge, I did not try to rush my solutions.   
I would rather spend on more day on a problem by thinking about it and come up with a better solution than previously.
   
Plus me and my friends were more fighting for concise solutions than submission time.
