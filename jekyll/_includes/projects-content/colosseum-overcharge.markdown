Detailed Info
--------------------

During the GameJam
Good :
what I did => Capacity manager
Work on the UI to show up when round ended
Bind the right input in rewired to know what the players selected
=====
Bad:
too bad I was pretty buzy at the same time.
Didn't have time to meet team members for the last day of work (Sunday) because it's the more important part where we should put pieces all together.
