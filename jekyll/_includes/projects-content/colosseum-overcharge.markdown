### Post-mortem
#### My work
= Capacity manager
Work on the UI to show up when round ended
Bind the right input in rewired to know what the players selected

#### What went well
* brainstorming useful
* tackle a lot of problems when talking about the final idea (with animator / artists)

#### What went wrong
* The Ludum Dare happened during a buzy week-end for me.
* Working remotly is not as efficient as working on place.
* This is specially true during our last day of work (Sunday) since we have to bring all the game pieces together. 
* Underestimate some tasks.

### Post-Gamejam
I might fix some bugs (like the breaking flow in a coming patch).  
Will see...
