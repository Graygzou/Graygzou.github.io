Detailed Info
--------------------
Lode Runner is a single player game where level can be seen as puzzles. 
We made 4 levels to test and show our game. 
We made sure to insert every items and blocs we developed so far. 
Each level belong to one of the world the player as to go through :
* Jungle World
* Fire World
* Snow World
* Death World

### Game Features
* Player movements (ZQSD)
* Player abilities (break a dirt cube, pick up an object, use an object)
* Custom puzzles floor (wood, stone, glue) to make puzzles harder and fun.
* Weapons (bombs, glue pistols) to slow and escape from enemies or solve puzzles.
* Several AI for enemies.

### Level editor
Like the original game "Lode Runner - The Legend Returns" we decided to create a game editor. 
We did not create a user interface for the editor so regular user will not be able to use it. 
We made this tool for game designer to help them create levels. 
They just have write down where blocs should be and to specify their kind.
