pitch: "Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language we like.
        People use this event as a speed contest, practice problems, or even to challenge each other.
        It's made by Eric Wastl and 2018 was the 4th edition."
