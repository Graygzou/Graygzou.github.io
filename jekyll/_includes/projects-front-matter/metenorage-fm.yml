        The course is the following : [Game Engines Principles (8INF871)](http://cours.uqac.ca/8INF871).

        We implemented this engine in Java with the framework [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/) (Lightweight Java Game Library).
        We choose to based our engine on a Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture because of his modularity and flexibility."
