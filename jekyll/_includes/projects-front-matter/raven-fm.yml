        It is originaly made by Mat Bucklandin his book, Programming Game AI By Example.
        This application has been completed for a school project at the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi (UQAC).
        The course is the following: [Artificial Intelligence for Video Games (8IAR125)](http://cours.uqac.ca/8IAR125).

        The gameplay of Raven is similar of a Quake-style deathmatch.
        When starting the game, severals bots spawned controlled by similar AI trying to win, by killing as many bots as possible.
        Bots can also pick up health or weapons if needed. The player could also take control of a bot by clicking on it.
