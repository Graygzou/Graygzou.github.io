More about myself
==================

I spent a lot of my spare time trying and learning stuff I find interesting (and there is A TON OF interesting things out there...). 

When I'm not doing that I exercise and don't miss an occasion to practice any kind of sports alone or with friends.
I also spent some time playing video games and petting my 4 years old black cat Lilo :
