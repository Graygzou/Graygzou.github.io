## Let's go big
For this year, I decided to try solving puzzle in Unreal Engine.
It will allows me to write custom C++ code in this engine, by creating node, and then use it to solve puzzle in blueprints.

Plus, I was hoping to have enough time to allow binding asset directly on the code, to visualize the puzzle solving process. Making it visually happeling.

## Making reusable node
Since I decided to use Unreal Engine, I did wanted to make everything in blueprints.
I wanted to do "real code" and then plug my custom module into a larger blueprints to use the power of the engine.

But, by making stuff reusable and tidy, a starting getting late on newest puzzles. Plus my learning was relatively slow compared to the work each challenge required.

## Taking a break
After taking too much delay, I finally gave up and moved to something else.
I might come back on this one day. Just to have the satisfaction of finishing it.
