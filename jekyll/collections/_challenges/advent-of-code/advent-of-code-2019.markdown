### Let's go big
For this year, I decided to try solving puzzle in Unreal Engine.
It will allows me to write custom C++ code in this engine, by creating node, and then use it to solve puzzle in blueprints.

Plus, I was hoping to have enough time to allow binding asset directly on the code, to visualize the puzzle solving process. Making it visually happeling.
