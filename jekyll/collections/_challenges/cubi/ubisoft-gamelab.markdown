## Before the D-Day
This challenge allow university students to showcase their abilities in making a game with other university with complementary skills. What they try to achieve is to mix technical universities with artistic one by having 4 "technical" students and 4 "artists" students. I put quotes because some might have to take care of game design and other topic which is not their main specialty.

In our case, we end-up being 8 "technical" students in the same university. Which is an advantage and a disadvantage at the same time:

- Of course communication and team planning could be a lot more easier. Being able to meet in a room all together to brainstorm and interact directly is always a plus. 
In addition, even if our team was made up of two smaller groups, we know a bit each other, so it was also easier to get moving on the project right away.

- On the other hand, without any qualified artists in our group, the hope to win some challenges and even, in my opinion, even the best prototype. 
Furthermore, for the most part, we had to find and buy assets. Meaning we could not go wild on things we wanted because it might not be available on the stores. 
Plus keeping a consistent art direction could be challenging if assets were made by different skills and styles.

## Brainstorm
This part took place at the Ubisoft Quebec studio.

The theme of this year was **"Change the world"**.

Brainstorming went really smooth and we come up with a lot of ideas. We expended some of them with our mentors.
Without dedicated designers, we didn't want a topic too sensitive or harmful to avoid creating something unconfortable for players to experience.
Dealing with wars and immigration for example could have well suited the theme but too risky without a proper design and art.

We finally came up with idea of north pole melting with penguins trying to do something about it by trying to move ice chunks back to their place. 
At the same time the art could be simple, and a lot of gameplay ideas emerged from that initial concept.

## Difficulties
We held regular meetings and try as much as possible to track features with Trello.
But we still encounters problems along the way:

- A common problem we face early on was keeping track of feature state and working in pair on it. Sometimes, a person did the ground of an architecture and another had to use to make something else. An example would be the IA controller based on the player one.    
Since our deadlines were really short, losing a day or two waiting for something that is already ready could cause tensions and unnecessary stress.

- A big technical challenge that we did not had time to integrate properly into our game, was the dynamic physic based water:   
The final iteration was performanced heavy and moving the "RnD team" as I was part of, to helping with last bugs and polish was more important than trying to optimize it.

## Personal post mortem
### What went well
- A lot of ideas came out from the brainstorm session and the final topic selected was promising.
- The final version of the game is polished and with a good quality overall.
- The ability of team members to accept decisions (game design or organization one) even if they disagree with it.
- We won one award. Which was the one we were targetting at first.

### What could be improved
- Settings more granular deadlines on risky feature to know when to "leave" it.
- Not having discuss personal goals for each member setup cause more and more tension as the project goes on.
- Making a team from groups with different size, could lead in marginalization of smallest groups during major decisions.
- Not trusting enough teammates and being resentful about their mistakes (in planning or technicals). Could lead to members giving up on the project.
