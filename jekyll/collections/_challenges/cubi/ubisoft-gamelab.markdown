## Technical description
The project page is also available on this website. If you seek technical details you might want to go checkout it out: [Penguin Panic](/projects/penguin-panic)

## Quick Overview
This challenge allow university students to showcase their abilities in making a game with other university with complementary skills. What they try to achieve is to mix technical universities with artistic one by having 4 "technical" students and 4 "artists" students. I put quotes because some might have to take care of game design and other topic which is not their main specialty.

In our case, we end-up being 8 "technical" students in the same university. Which is an advantage and a disadvantage at the same time:

Of course communication and team planning could be a lot more easier. Being able to meet in a room all together to brainstorm and interact directly is always a plus. In addition, even if our team was made up of two smaller groups, we know a bit each other, so it was also easier to get moving on the project right away.


## Post mortem
### What went well
- Brainstorm on the theme was well made and the final topic selected was promising.
- The final version of the game is polished and with a good quality.
- We won one award. Which was the one we were targetting at first.

### What could be improved
- Not having discuss personal goals for each member setup cause more and more tension as the project goes on.
- Making a team from groups with different size, could lead in marginalization of smallest groups during major decisions.
- Not trusting enough teammates and being resentful about their mistakes (in planning or technicals). Could lead to members giving up.
