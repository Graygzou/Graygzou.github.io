## What is the google hashcode?
It's an event organized by Google divided into two parts. In the qualification round, Students team have to solve a problem in a given amount a time to have a chance to be in the finals. Same process happens in the final round.

The majority of (if not all) presented problems are [NP-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness). Which means a certain way of dealing with them and a more "thinking" process than fast. No matter when you submit your solution in the time period, if you have bigger points, you will win.

Challenges are presented with a real life application. Which I believe is what could be done with it if batter solution is found.
In the 2016 edition, the problem was about [Delivery](https://storage.googleapis.com/coding-competitions.appspot.com/HC/2016/hashcode2016_qualification_task.pdf). To put it simple, you had to tell flying robots to delivers products from warehouses to customers in the most efficency way possible.

This year was about [Streaming videos](https://storage.googleapis.com/coding-competitions.appspot.com/HC/2017/hashcode2017_qualification_task.pdf).

## Training
The computer science club in my engineering school organized a training session before the big day in order to get used to "hashcode" problems.   

In my opinion, You don't tackle those problems in the same way than regular fast programming challenges. Since you only have only one problem to focus on, thinking of many techniques ahead before rushing into code can be benefical. It's not like 5 exercices with some having common "archetype".

Since I was not used to small challenge like that (2 hours long), me and my partner started some small challenge like the Hourse Robber one.

Then, the real training exercice was about a robot how wanted to reproduce a picture (the input) thanks to his painting brush. He could which between brush with different size (square, rectangles) each with a given size. Of course, we had to determine the optimal path the robot would have to take to reproduce the picture and use the less movement possible (to be confirmer, my memories might be rusty).

## Qualifying round
The problem was the give:
> Given a description of cache servers, network end points and videos, along with predicted requests for individual videos, decide which videos to put in which cache server in order to minimize the average waiting time for all requests.

We had the idea to re-use something we were studying in a course called [Operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research): [Flow network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_network). It quite fitted well the problem asked in our opinion. So we started going down that road just to see what could come up from that.

We did score a bit a point with an early prototype of this method.

Unfortunaly, we did not submit another score with a better version and our chance to go to the final vanished. Still a fun experience with great collaboration around a complex topic.
