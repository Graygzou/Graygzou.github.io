pitch: "_F1® Mobile Racing_ est un jeu mobile officiel du championnat _FIA FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP™_.
        The core gameloop of the game is around duels between players in a race that can take several forms (grid start, overtaking, etc.)
        <br/>
        Player are able to customize their own f1 car by adding stickers and livery on it.
        They can also select the helmet they want to use, pilots or cars, based on real formula 1 ones.
        Tracks also correspond to the official one pilots were running on.
        <br/>
        If players didn't want to play against other player, they could either play:
        - Single mode were they're able to train on available tracks, or
        - GPEvents which simulate Grand Prix and allows player to win points based on their performances. 
        <br/>
        Global leaderboards are available in the later to let players compare their cumulated points if needed."
