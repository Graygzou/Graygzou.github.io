        Clear levels by reaching the exit, but there's a twist! 
        You can only press and hold your move commands ONCE. 
        Study the enemy's patterns, keep track of your paths you take and figure out how to reach the exit!

        The game is available both for Windows client and also WebGL meaning you don't need to download anything.
