<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Penguin Panic is a 3D multiplayer exploration game. It has been made for the Ubisoft Game Lab Competition 2018. A brief description of this event is available here : <a href="https://montreal.ubisoft.com/en/our-engagements/education/university/game-lab-competition/">Ubisoft Game Lab Competition</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Award of the Best Technical Challenge and Innovation.</strong></p>

<p>Our story takes place in 2042s. Human activity has continued to spread, bringing with it the progression of global warming. <br />
The Arctic is falling apart and the North Pole is drifting in the ocean. <br />
While the situation is critical, a duo of scientists who study the glacial regions makes a strange discovery: the penguins are organizing to bring the Glacier to the North Pole! <br />
Amazed by what they have in front of them, the two scientists have a revelation: the courage of these little penguins could well inspire the whole world! <br />
They decided to launch a broadcast on a real-time streaming platform very popular in recent years: Twatch.tv. <br />
You play the leader penguin of this colony. Your mission: return the Glacier to the North Pole to save the Arctic!</p>
