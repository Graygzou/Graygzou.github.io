<h2 id="detailed-info">Detailed Info</h2>
<p>I had the chance to work on Cuphead made by the MDHR studio during my internship.
I had to provide a high level of polish on an already launched game for his new update.</p>

<p>The main task were related to the UI but also some bugs:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>UI bugs fixes</td>
      <td>UI Integration</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>UI animations bugs fixes</td>
      <td>UI features (make the glow of the boss title)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>controllers bugs</td>
      <td>UI animations bugs</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>localization bugs</td>
      <td>bring legacy branch up-to-date (git task)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>All of the above by keeping an eye on the English version.</p>

<h4 id="what-ive-done">What I’ve done</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Multi purpose script to move UI element based on the language.</li>
  <li>Custom editor to make the usage of this script easily.</li>
  <li>Deploy test build to steam (throught Steamwork) and GOG to test new controllers (Nintendo Switch and Steam controller).</li>
  <li>Communicate with the maximum of people involved to be sure what the game looks like was fine 
(even if most of the time they were checking, at the beginning at least).</li>
</ul>

<!--
To give an order of size Cuphead is :
- 81 death quotes
- 
In 11 new languages !-->

<h2 id="post-mortem">Post-Mortem</h2>
<h4 id="what-helps-me-a-lot">What helps me a lot</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Cheats in the game (instant win, instant lose, switching between languages, etc.)</li>
  <li>Self organisation (with a bloc note / write (huge) comments on JIRA task)</li>
  <li>TextMeshPro features (font generation parameters, per character spacing (kerning), etc.)</li>
  <li>Work on my own branch and create side branch for bug (which will be rebase when finished)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="what-could-be-better-made-by-me">What could be better (made by me)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>a lot of tasks involved manual QA from me. Which is painful.</li>
  <li>Not use -f (force) when using git command (I guess we all have been there…)</li>
  <li>A tool that take screenshot automatically of the same configuration in many languages would have been super useful.</li>
</ul>
