<p>Navigate the site directly, it’s more fun right? <img class="emoji" title=":grin:" alt=":grin:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f601.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<h4 id="my-own-theme">My own theme</h4>
<p>Jekyll is really powerful because it can be use theme out of the box published by other developers / designers.
A lot of them can be found here : <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">http://jekyllthemes.org/</a>.</p>

<p>But after a quick search, I did not find exactly what I wanted. 
Plus I already had a lot of feature coded in HTML + CSS from my previous website that I wanted to keep.</p>

<p>I decided to create my own theme starting from jekyll minimal theme.
The purpose of this theme is to make a simple portfolio without heavy animations, etc.</p>

<p>Because we all know that people are busy and don’t have time to scroll 1000 times to find right information <img class="emoji" title=":wink:" alt=":wink:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f609.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<h4 id="build-my-own-pipeline">Build my own pipeline</h4>
<p>Like a lot of people do, I decided to host my website on Github with Github Page.</p>

<p>But, each time I commit a change, before deploying it to the right branch, I create some python scripts in order to “generate” some of my project for my website: 
Indeed some information in them come from GitHub directly. 
So those scripts help merging GitHub info (coming from the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub API</a>) with static one (committed to the website’s repository)</p>

<p>Travis CI helps a bit in all of that in order to make things smoother. 
Also allowing to hook stuffs like <a href="https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer">html-proofer</a> for example.</p>
